	<h2><br>Low and Slow</br></h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide.</i></dfn>In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<cite class="https://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Geeks-Science-Great-Hacks/dp/0596805888"> Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as,<q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
